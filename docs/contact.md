??? tip "Want `mailto:` buttons like this to actually open in your browser instead?"

    This is a longstanding annoyance of mine that took far too long to fix: individual browser settings frequently default to the OS's email software.

    Here's the basic process (for Gmail):

    === "Chrome"

        0. Check your existing Gmail tab for a overlapping diamond icon at the right side of the browser bar.
            - If it's there, click it and `Allow` Gmail to be your default email handler and "open all email links".
        1. Close any open Gmail tabs.
        2. Navigate to `chrome://settings/handlers`.
        3. Enable (it should be enabled by default) "Allow sites to ask to become default handlers for protocols".
        4. Close the settings tab.
        5. Launch Gmail `mail.google.com` and look for the overlapping diamonds (as mentioned in Step 1 above) to `Allow` Gmail to handle email links going forward.

        **Troubleshooting**: if the icon doesn't show up, restart your browser.

        Here's a [reference from the Google forums](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/57026170?hl=en&msgid=57286094){target="_blank"} outlining the same process I've described.

    === "Firefox"

        1. Open the Firefox menu ("Options" for PC, "Preferences" for Mac).
        2. Go to "General" > "Applications".
        3. Search "mailto" in the search bar.
        4. Click on the corresponding "Action" cell and select "Use Gmail".

    === "Edge (Windows only)"

        1. Click the "Start" button, then click "Default Programs".
        2. Click "Set your default programs".
        3. Go to "Programs" > "Gmail", and set Gmail as the default.
        4. Click "OK".
