## Product Documentation

### Shovels AI

I was the designer, architect, and chief author of the [Shovels AI](https://docs.shovels.ai){target="_blank"} platform and developer documentation hub.

I worked with the Shovels team to determine what content they wanted me to create, the target audiences, and the tone and style guide. I used a docs-as-code philosophy on the [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com){target="_blank"} platform to write content in MarkdownX, CSS, and React. 

Upon completion, I handed it off for the team to handle from that point onwards. 

Here are some examples you can read online:

### Uptime.com

I was a senior member of the Support team, and as such was tasked with running the customer-facing technical documentation in their [Help Center](https://support.uptime.com){target="_blank"}, hosted in Zendesk Guide and written in Markdown and HTML.

During this process I lead a catalog-wide content audit and review prior to re-organizing the existing documentation and bringing in offline sources which hadn't made it to publication yet. 

While I had senior editorial oversight of the entire Help Center, there were a few articles that I fully wrote myself(1).
