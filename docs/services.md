# Technical Writing Services

Here's a quick (but not exhaustive) overview of the services I offer. 

If there's a specific documentation-related task or project that isn't listed here, include that in your contact email proposal so we can discuss it further!

## Documentation

These refer to whichever combination or modality your team prefers between developer docs, documentation hub, knowledge base, help center, etc.

These can be for your SaaS, DaaS, or other software product, your developer portal and API docs, your application SDK, or physical product.

| Service | Potential Components | Example |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creation** | Design, Architecture, Deployment, Linters, Style Guide, Initial Content | Your platform is about to launch, and needs a brand new documentation hub, including tutorial, troubleshooting, and reference content, with a style guide and pipeline for internal maintenance going forward. |
| **Maintenance** | Automation, Workflows, Updates, Release Notes, Oversight | Your existing documentation hub needs an automated update pipeline to include future platform and product content updates and release notes, plus my editorial oversight to ensure output meets your existing standards. |
| **Overhaul** | Review, Re-design, Re-write, Other Upgrades | Your outdated documentation hub needs a fresh look, including a architectural re-design, new CSS, optimized performance, and KPI and engagement tracking. |
| **Integration** | Support Ticket Autocompletion, Chat-bot Connection, MCP Server, UI Embedding | You want to connect your new documentation with your Support Team's ticketing software (with varying degrees of AI-usage), to auto-reply with possible solutions, relevant documentation articles, etc. |
| **Project** | New Product Release, Any Single Item Above | Your platform is releasing a new product, and a suite of new documentation content is needed to be prepped in your documentation hub for launch. |

## API Specs

These refer to the API specification (OpenAPI, Swagger, etc) for your platform or product's API. 

| Service | Potential Components | Example |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specification** | Creation, Upgrade, Publication | Your new API is built, but not in OAS yet. It also needs to be deployed for users to view on your existing developer documentation hub. |
| **Playground** | Code Samples, Recipes or Cookbooks, Tutorials, Additional Content | You want your users to be able to test your API endpoints before using them, and want the associated resources to support that user exploration. |

## General Content and Copy

These refer to any other *technical* content you may need me to write for you.

| Service | Potential Components | Example |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Educational Material** | Training Modules, eLearning Content, Onboarding Materials | You have an internal onboarding program that's out-of-date and in need of a refresh to better bring new employees up to speed. |
| **Blogs** | Technical Blogs, Thought Pieces, White Papers, Marketing Content | You need a series of technical blogs aimed at a developer audience covering your new product. |
| **UI or UX Copy** | In-application Content, Tooltips, Announcement Banners | Your product UI is being upgraded and needs accompanying labels and tooltips. |

## Timelines and Durations

My projects usually break down into two categories: outcome-based deliveries or time-based availabilities. 

All contracts will have an SOW and terms for extensions. 

**Outcome-based**: We scope out the details of your project, and I deliver and hand it off by the established deadline.

**Time-based**: We scope out a range of projects, with room for additional projects that may arise, to complete over a series of months or years. I commit to an availability for weekly work-hours and contact.

!!! note "FTE Option"
    Generally, I'm open to proposals for FTE, **especially** after a successful project is completed. This shows you that I'm a good fit for your team and shows me that you like my work and I'm eager to collaborate further.
    
    However, if your team is looking to bring on a technical writer full time in the `Staff`, `Senior`, or `Lead` roles I would be happy to discuss that with you as well.

## Billing

Similar to the "timelines" section above, billing breaks down in a variety of ways based on your needs and budget. 

- **Flat fee**: 50% up front, 50% on delivery.
    - Example: *You've budgeted $5k and thirty days to get your documentation hub live and ready for a platform launch. I'll be available by email, slack, or phone throughout, with dedicated time slots throughout the week to collaborate/touch base with your team/SMEs.*

- **Hourly (most common)**: Billed monthly via invoice (ACH, bank transfer, or direct deposit). We set an hourly rate in our SOW and contract based on your budget, project complexity, and necessary availability from me. 
    - Example: *You want me embedded with your Product and Engineering team for six months, during which time I'll build a documentation hub, create technical guide content, and integrate the documentation process with engineering tickets. I'll be available for 20 hours per week for collaboration and discussion.*

- **Retainer**: Billed monthly or annually via invoice (ACH, bank transfer, or direct deposit). We set a minimum and maximum hourly availability per week or month in our SOW for the duration of the contract (with clauses for extensions beyond the stated maximum if needed).
    - Example: *You want me embedded with your team(s), even if details of the projects haven't been completely scoped just yet. I'll help in whatever capacity I can, and reserve the allotted time in my schedule purely for this project regardless of weekly or daily load.*
