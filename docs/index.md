# Welcome!

I'm Alex Brown: Seattle-based technical writer and documentation expert by day, novelist and woodworker by night. 

I work with clients of all sizes and industries, from Y Combinator grads to Fortune 100 enterprises, to take their documentation to the next level. 

I have more than 7 years of experience in SaaS, DaaS (Data-as-a-Service), and other product environments, and I excel at both creating documentation from the ground up as well as modernizing the documentation you have for today's AI-forward era. 

Here's the whistle-stop tour of my website:
